<body>
    
    <p>In the land of Marijoa, a royal family held the highest status in the world. They lived a <br>
        prestigious life, seemingly untouched by worry. The people admired them for their kindness and <br>
        generosity, and the royal family, in turn, maintained a facade of benevolence. Yet beneath this <br> 
        veneer lay secrets that no one dared to question.
    </p>

    <p>One day, Prince Lev, the future heir to the throne, decided to leave the palace to wander the<br>
        kingdom incognito. His sudden disappearance caused panic among the palace’s staff, as his <br>
         safety was of utmost importance. Meanwhile, Lev, disguised as an ordinary citizen, roamed the <br>
         streets of Marijoa.
    </p>

    <p>As he wandered through a crowded marketplace, he came upon a boy being bullied by a group of <br>
         thugs. Without hesitation, Lev intervened, driving the thugs away. Turning to the boy, he asked, <br>
          “What’s your name?”
    </p>

    <p>The boy, trembling but grateful, replied, “Shiro.”</p>

    <p>Shiro came from a poor family struggling to survive. Forced to work at a young age to support <br>
        his parents and siblings, his life was a constant battle against poverty. The kindness of this <br>
        stranger was something Shiro had never experienced before.
    </p>

    <p>“Nice to meet you, Shiro,” Lev said with a warm smile before disappearing back into the crowd.</p>
    
    <p>The following day, Prince Lev returned to the marketplace, hoping to see Shiro again. To his <br>
        surprise, he found him in the same spot. This time, Shiro asked for his name.
    </p>    

    <p>“I’m Lev,” the prince replied.</p>

    <p>Shiro froze, his eyes widening in disbelief. “A-a-are you the prince?!” he stammered.</p>

    <p>Lev nodded. “Yes, I’m Prince Lev, heir to the throne.”</p>

    <p>Shiro’s heart sank as rumors he’d heard about the royal family resurfaced in his mind. It was said <br>
        that those indebted to the royals were forced into lifelong servitude, treated as little more than <br>
        slaves. But as he looked at Lev, he brushed the thought aside. This young prince seemed <br>
        different;  he was kind and genuine.
    </p>
    
    <p>The two grew close, their unlikely friendship deepening with every meeting. Lev’s dull palace <br>
        routine was replaced with joy and excitement as he explored the kingdom with Shiro. Shiro, too, <br>
        felt a rare sense of happiness in Lev’s company. Their friendship bridged the vast chasm between <br>
        their worlds.
    </p>
    
    <p>But their bond did not go unnoticed. Lev’s frequent disappearances raised suspicion among the <br>
         royal family. One day, King Orfin, Lev’s father, sent a mercenary to secretly follow him. When <br>
          the mercenary reported back that the prince was meeting with a commoner, the king was furious.
    </p>
    
    <p>“What’s wrong, Father?” Lev asked upon returning to the palace, sensing the tension.</p>

    <p>“WHAT’S WRONG?!” the king thundered. “You tell me! Consorting with a lowly commoner <br>
         who’s likely leeching off you?!”
    </p>

    <p>Before Lev could defend himself, his father forbade him from ever seeing Shiro again. Over the <br>
         next few years, Lev’s perspective gradually changed under his father’s influence. Slowly, his <br>
         desire to please his father and his exposure to the greed and politics of the court eroded his <br>
         kind-hearted nature. He became cold, distant, and obsessed with power.
    </p>

    <p>Unbeknownst to Lev, Shiro’s life took a dark turn. Mercenaries hired by Lev’s father kidnapped <br>
         him, and he was subjected to weeks of torture before being sold into slavery. Forced to work <br>
          tirelessly, Shiro’s once vibrant spirit was crushed.
    </p>

    <p>Fifteen years passed. Lev, now the king, ascended the throne with great pomp and ceremony. Yet <br>
         the man who stood before his people was a far cry from the compassionate prince he once was. <br>
          Blinded by ambition, he sought only to expand his power and ensure absolute loyalty from his <br>
          subjects.
    </p>

    <p>As king, Lev began to uncover the hidden atrocities of his kingdom: slave trafficking, auctions <br>
         selling human lives, systemic racism, and rampant discrimination. But rather than act to end <br>
        these practices, he turned a blind eye, just as his father had.</p>
    
    <p>One day, while inspecting the slave pens, Lev’s gaze fell upon a man who seemed oddly familiar. <br>
        Curious, he ordered his guards to bring the man to the palace.
    </p>

    <p>“State your name,” Lev commanded, his voice cold and authoritative.</p>

    <p>The man, trembling with fear, replied, “My name is Shiro, your majesty.”</p>

    <p>The name struck Lev like a bolt of lightning. Memories long buried began to resurface. “Shiro?” <br>
        he whispered, his voice softening. “Is it really you?”
    </p>

    <p>Shiro, confused by the king’s sudden change in demeanor, nodded hesitantly. “Y-yes, your <br>
         majesty. I am Shiro.”
    </p>

    <p>Tears welled in Lev’s eyes as the realization dawned on him. This broken man before him was <br>
        the same boy who had once been his closest friend. “It’s me, Lev,” he said, his voice trembling. <br>
        “Do you remember me?”
    </p>

    <p>Shiro stared at him, disbelief etched across his face. Slowly, recognition dawned. “L-Lev?” he <br>
        whispered. “Is it really you?”
    </p>

    <p>The two embraced, their shared pain and regret spilling over in tears. Shiro recounted the horrors <br>
         he had endured, and Lev listened in silence, guilt consuming him. He realized how far he had <br> 
         strayed from the kind boy he once was and the promises of justice he had made to himself.
    </p>

    <p>Determined to make amends, Lev vowed to dismantle the corrupt systems his father had upheld. <br>
         He freed all the slaves in the kingdom and provided them with compensation to rebuild their <br>
         lives. His actions sparked outrage among the nobility, but Lev was resolute. He would not allow <br>
        the sins of the past to continue.
    </p>

    <p>Shiro, seeing Lev’s genuine remorse, forgave him. “It wasn’t your fault,” Shiro said. “You didn’t <br>
        know what was happening. What matters now is that you’re making it right.”
    </p>

    <p>Lev appointed Shiro as his closest advisor, trusting no one else to guide him in his mission to <br>
         rebuild the kingdom. Together, they worked to create a land where justice and equality prevailed. <br>
          Their friendship, once broken, became a beacon of hope for Marijoa’s future. And for the first <br>
           time in years, Lev and Shiro found joy and laughter once more.
