                    A seed is small, but holds a tree,<br>
                    A child may dream, and so shall be.<br>
                    Their voices light, yet sharp and true,<br>
                    Their ideas fresh, their wisdom new.<br>
                    <br>
                    An adult's path may seem unclear,<br>
                    But time's not wasted, nor to fear.<br>
                    A spark can rise when least they know,<br>
                    And brilliance waits for chance to show.<br>
                    <br>
                    The aged hands that shake with grace,<br>
                    Have built the world, each line a trace.<br>
                    Their strength lives on, though time may wear,<br>
                    Their stories speak—so stop, and care.<br>
                    <br>
                    We are all pages in time's great book,<br>
                    Each age a chapter, take a look.<br>
                    For young, for old, for those unseen,<br>
                    Respect the story yet between.

                    A child may stumble, trip, and fall,<br>
                    But don't mistake them weak or small.<br>
                    Their minds are stars, alive and bright,<br>
                    Unshaped by fear, alight with might.<br>
                    <br>
                    The questions they ask, the dreams they chase,<br>
                    Are seeds of change, a future's place.<br>
                    Don't silence their thoughts, don't call them naïve,<br>
                    For the boldest wonders are born when they believe.

                    The middle years, a silent climb,<br>
                    A dance with doubt, a race with time.<br>
                    The world may ask, "What have you done?"<br>
                    But not all battles end in sun.<br>
                    <br>
                    Some paths are long, some sparks take time,<br>
                    Not every hill is meant to climb.<br>
                    Do not dismiss the quiet fight—<br>
                    The unseen work that builds the light.

                    These wrinkled hands, they shaped the earth,<br>
                    They've known both sorrow and of mirth.<br>
                    Beneath the grey, the years are stored,<br>
                    Each line a story, each heart adored.<br>
                    <br>
                    Don't call them weak, don't look away,<br>
                    Their wisdom speaks of yesterday.<br>
                    A bridge they are from past to now,<br>
                    So listen close, and learn to bow.
